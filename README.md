Code.Fun.Do++ Project Idea :

We are planning to make an android application for the code.fun.do project.

It will be a natural disaster management and distress relief app for disasters like earthquakes, floods, etc. 

It will have the following features :- 
  
  1. In case of a natural disaster the app will alert the user and give him directions to nearby safe zones. For eg. In case of      an earthquake, users will be given directions to an open area like a park which is away from buildings.

  2. During a natural disaster, people who are in need may not get help in time which leads to fatal consequences. Our app will      try to prevent this by sending a distress signal until the user marks himself safe on the notification sent by the app.        All the distress calls will be marked on a map which can be seen by rescue team or anyone who is willing to help.

  3. Users who are in unsafe zone will have an option to to mark themself safe so that their friends and family can be assured      of their well being.
